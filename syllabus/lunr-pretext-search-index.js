Apply basic combinatoric techniques to counting problems.    Develop basic skills to construct mathematically rigorous arguments and proofs.    Gain exposure to the basics of program analysis (program correctness, recurrences, asymptotic analysis).    Demonstrate a familiarity with and an ability to reason about discrete structures\/data types (integers, strings, bit strings, sets, relations, functions, graphs, trees).       Meeting Times and Locations  Both sections have lecture meetings in ... LEC 001 meets TR 11am 12:15pm and LEC 002 meets TR 9:30 10:45am. Each student is enrolled in one 50-minute discussion section led by one of the teaching assistants. Your discussion section meets either on Monday or Wednesday. Check your Student Center for your discussion number, time, and location.    How the Credit Hours are Met by the Course  This class meets for two 75-minute lectures and one 50-minute discussion each week over the semester and carries the expectation that students will work on course learning activities (e.g. reading, problem sets, papers, and studying) for about six hours outside of classroom per week. The syllabus includes more information about meeting times and expectations for student work.     Course Staff   Instructor   Dr. Mitch Keller   My pronouns are he\/him\/his. I ask that you address me as Prof. Keller or Dr. Keller , the appropriate professional forms. Since this is not high school, please do not address me as Mr. Keller . In general, you will find that I am not an overly formal individual. However, academia has a long history of marginalizing scholars professors, librarians, and students who don't present as the Hollywood image of a professor (older, white, male). Using titles for all your instructors is a small way that we can make the academy more inclusive. Therefore, in solidarity with my colleagues of all identities and backgrounds, Prof. Keller is the form of address that I prefer.

Office hours are posted on Canvas, including updates in the event any individual office hour is cancelled or rescheduled.     Textbook and Other Required Materials     Textbook  The required course text is the ebook Introduction to Discrete Mathematics by Irani et al. The ISBN is 978-1-394-05895-2. A subscription is $64. Students may begin subscribing on January 7, 2025 and the cutoff to subscribe is April 26, 2025. Subscriptions will last until May 23, 2025. To subscribe, click any zyBooks assignment link in Canvas and subscribe. (Do not go to the zyBooks website and create a new account.)     Canvas  Course materials will be posted to or linked from Canvas . This includes lecture slides, discussion worksheets, zyBook Participation and Challenge Activities, sample test questions, and written homework assignments. Announcements from the instructor and TAs will also be posted using Canvas. You are responsible for reading Canvas announcements in a timely manner.    Gradescope  You will scan and submit your written homework to Gradescope. Homework will be graded and returned to you within Gradescope. Tests and the final exam will be taken on paper, but the instructional team will scan them and upload them to Gradescope. Graded tests and the final exam will be returned to you using Gradescope. You will be able to access Gradescope using links from Canvas.    Piazza  We will use Piazza . This page is a forum for you to discuss the material of this class with other students and your TAs and\/or instructor. Posts to this page should be confined to questions regarding the material and logistical questions about the class (e.g., exam dates and locations). Please do not use email for math questions.  Any posts containing comments (either positive or negative) about the instructors, the class, the students, or anything else, will be deleted. Unprofessional conduct may result in disciplinary action.       Assessments   zyBook Participation Activities  Reading assignments including questions graded for completion to give you the opportunity to check your understanding will be regularly assigned in our zyBook. These assignments are meant to be done before we cover content in lecture so that we have more time for active learning in class. You will receive full credit for a zyBook Participation Activity if you answer the questions. Because these zyBook Participation Activities are your first exposure to the material, we do not expect you to understand everything from the reading alone. You will gain the most from these activities if you take them seriously, think about the questions before answering, and work to understand the reasoning for the correct answer when you get a question incorrect.   zyBook Participation Activities are due each Tuesday morning at 8am CT. They are worth 3% of your course grade. No late zyBook Participation Activities will be accepted, but the lowest three scores will be dropped.    Discussion Participation  Starting in the second week, the teaching assistants will take attendance in discussion. Mathematics is a human activity, and we learn by engaging with other humans. Discussion allows you to do this in a small enough group that every student can interact with peers and their TA during each meeting. Students who do not actively participate during activities in discussion may not receive credit for participation. You must attend the discussion section for which you are registered; missed discussion sections may not be made up. However, we will drop three, so discussion participation will be taken out of 10 and is 3% of your course grade.    zyBook Challenge Activities  Most weeks you will have a zyBook Challenge Activity. Unlike the zyBook Participation Activities, the zyBook Challenge Activities are (automatically) graded for correctness. The zyBook Challenge Activities follow up on material from lecture after you have also had time to work on the material in discussion.  zyBook Challenge Activities are due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. They are worth 7% of your course grade. No late zyBook Challenge Activities will be accepted, but the lowest two scores will be dropped.    Written Homework  Most weeks you will have a written homework assignment. These will give you an opportunity to write out proofs and solutions in the manner that you will be expected to on the exams. You will submit your solutions using Gradescope following instructions provided on Canvas. The questions on each written homework will be graded for correctness by the TAs and graders.  Collaborating with other students on the written homework is encouraged, but you must write up all reasoning and solutions on your own (in other words, no copying). Failure to abide by this guideline could be construed as a form of academic dishonesty.  The purpose of this course is to develop your ability to understand and construct mathematical arguments or proofs. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and applications (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Copilot, DALL-E, and others) for written homework does not support the learning objectives of this course and is prohibited. Using them in any way for written homework in this course is a violation of the course’s expectations and will be addressed through UW–Madison’s academic misconduct policy, specifically UWS 14.03(1)b (b) Uses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise.  Each problem on written homework should be completed with neat, understandable, detailed solutions and explanations. Your explanations and proofs must be sound and rigorous, paying attention to detail and clarity.  Written homework is due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. It is worth 15% of your course grade. Late written homework will generally not be accepted. Since you likely will either experience a technical difficulty (e.g., missed the deadline, your computer shut down as you were submitting it, internet outage, etc.) or a personal emergency (being sick, attending a funeral, etc.) during the semester, the two lowest two written homework scores will be dropped. You do not need to contact your instructor or TA if such a situation does come up.    Tests and Exams  This course will have two tests and a final exam. Each will be worth 24% of your course grade. The dates and times for these assessments are:   Test I  Wednesday, February 26, 2025. 7:30 9pm. Location announced via Canvas.    Test II  Wednesday, April 9, 2025. 7:30 9pm. Location announced via Canvas.    Final Exam  Tuesday, May 6, 2025. 5:05 7:05pm. Location announced via Canvas.     Students must use the form provided on Canvas to inform the instructor of conflicts with the dates and times of the tests or final exam during the first two week of classes. Reports of conflicts will be reviewed. Submitting incorrect information in order to take a test or the final exam at a different time may be considered an act of academic misconduct.  During exams, students will not be allowed to use any notes or electronic devices. Ample space will be provided on the exams for you to show your work. You must bring a writing utensil.   Added March 7, 2025 : If a student's overall course grade would increase by using their final exam score in place of the lower of their scores on Test I and Test II, they will receive the grade based on this alternative grade computation method.     Grading  The grade components and their are all identified above. For quick reference, they are also summarized in the table below.    Component  Weight    zyBook Participation Activities  3%    Discussion Participation  3%    zyBook Challenge Activities  7%    Written Homework  15%    Test I  24%    Test II  24%    Final Exam  24%    Grades will be calculated to two decimal places. They will not be rounded up to the next integer. The lower cutoff for each letter grade is given in the table below. It is possible that these cutoffs will be adjusted at the end of the semester. However, if this is done, it will only be done in a way that benefits students by lowering the cutoff to earn a given letter grade.     Letter Grade  Lower Cutoff    A  92%    AB  87%    B  82%    BC  77%    C  70%    D  60%    F  0%     Incomplete Grades  Incomplete grades will be assigned only under extraordinary circumstances in accordance with L&S policy, which states as follows:    An Incomplete (I) may be reported for a student who has been enrolled in a course with a passing grade until near the end of the semester\/term and then, due to illness or some other unusual and substantiated cause beyond the student’s control, has been unable to take or complete the final examination (or to complete some limited amount of term work). An Incomplete is not given to a student who stays away from a final examination unless the student proves to the instructor that he or she was prevented from attending as indicated above. In the absence of such proof the grade reported will be an F. Even when a student can provide verifiable documentation, a student may still earn a grade of F if his\/her work convinces the instructor that the student cannot successfully pass the course.    If you feel an incomplete grade may be warranted, you must contact me before the end of the final examination period on Friday, May 9, 2025.
